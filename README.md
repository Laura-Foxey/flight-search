# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Navigate into `./flight-search.API` and type 

### `dotnet restore`
into the terminal to restore dependencies.

To run the API, type 
### `dotnet run`
and allow the terminal to run in order for the front-end to communicate with the back-end.

In the main project directory (cd..), open another terminal window and install all dependencies using:
### `npm i` 

After the lenghty installation is done, type in: 
### `npm start`

A browser window with `http://localhost:3000` should open.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
